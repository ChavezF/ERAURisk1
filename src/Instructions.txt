On  your  turn,  try  to  capture  territories  by  defeating  your  opponents’
armies. But be careful: Winning battles will depend on careful planning,
quick decisions and bold moves. You’ll have to place your forces wisely,
attack at just the right time and fortify your defenses against all enemies.
Note: At any time during the game, you may trade in Infantry pieces for the
equivalent (see page 4) in Cavalry or Artillery if you need to, or wish to.
Each of your turns consists of three steps, in this order:
1.  Getting  and  placing  new  armies;
2. Attacking, if you choose to, by rolling the dice;
3.  Fortifying  your  position.
